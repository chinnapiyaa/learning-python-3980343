# LinkedIn Learning Python course by Joe Marini
# Example file for variables and basic types


# Basic data types in Python: Numbers, Strings, Booleans 
# Variable names must start with a letter or _, and can have numbers. They are case sensitive. 
myint = 10
myfloat = 13.2576
mystr = " this is a string"
mybool = True


# We can display the content of a variable using the print() function
#print(myint)
print(mystr)

# Operators are used to perform operations on variables
#print(myint + myfloat)
#print(myint * myfloat)
#print(myint / myfloat)
#print(myint % 3)

another_string = " we have added some more text"
print (mystr + another_string)

# Logical and comparison operators 
print(myint == 10)
print(myfloat != 10.0)
print(myint > 25)
print(myfloat < 20.0)

# re-declaring a variable works
